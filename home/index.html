  <h3>52IRL started off as a prayer organization called Doubtless Prayer made by DERRICK VINCENT BARLOW.
  </h3> 
    <p class="three"> Prayer became words. Words became action. Action became this business that is made to reach out to those who sit alone all day playing video games. DERRICK started this business in prayer as people bullied him into a corner.</h3></p>
    <h3>Please do not be judgmental of an individual who has already been persecuted enough.
    </h3></p>
  <p class="three">
      If people are to judge anyone, then people need to judge themselves first because they were either the bully or the enabler of the bully if said people did not act to stop the bullying. Those who acted to stop the bullying got bullied, separated, silenced, isolated, some got sick, but some may be dead. The bully is a large group of individuals who throw around their authority and rights without regard to the freedoms the bullies deny to others. <br></p>
      <h3>"DUPED: Game of the Marionettes" is a title that will be used to prove to a blind world that an unknown entity is taking advantage of the world.
      </h3> 
  <p class="three">
    It is not a sly scheme that used to steal from others. It is a rhetorical, fictionally expressed argument in a story poised to become a video game. The argument is against an unknown evil force that still dominates the religious, the non-religious, and the irreligious to this day. The argument is for a peaceful solution to a complex issue that the world faces today. </p> -->
